    "\n",
    "This Spark context is a JVM process that gives access to a Spark **driver** which schedules the tasks and spans tasks across Worker nodes through Executors.\n",
    "In brief, the Spark driver communicates with all the Worker nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each Worker node consists of one or more Executor(s) who are responsible for running the Task. Executors register themselves with Driver. The Driver has all the information about the Executors at all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This working combination of Driver and Workers is known as **Spark Application**.\n",
    "\n",
    "JVM: Java virtual machine that load, verifies and executes Java bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../First-steps-with-cloud-computing/img/spark_context.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark Application is launched with the help of the **Cluster Manager**. Spark is dependent on the **Cluster Manager** to launch the Executors and also the Driver (in Cluster mode). \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark can be run with any of the 5 following **Cluster Manager** :\n",
    "\n",
    "    - local : Driver use CPU threads on your local machine\n",
    "    - Spark Standalone Mode : A basic resource manager provided by Spark\n",
    "    - YARN : the historical resource manager commonly used in traditional Big Data infrastructures (Courdera or Hortonworks cluster for instance)\n",

    "2. `take(n)`, asking for `n` first rows\n",

    "[^5]: `first()` is exactly `take(1)` ([ref]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37495039/difference-between-spark-rdds-take1-and-first)) and show prints the result instead of returning it as a list of rows ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53884994/what-is-the-difference-between-dataframe-show-and-dataframe-take-in-spark-t))\n",

    "**This has advantages:** on huge data, you don't want to accidently perform a computation that is not needed. Also, Spark can optimize each **stage** of the execution in regard to what comes next. For instance, filters will be executed as early as possible, since it diminishes the number of rows on which to perform later operations. On the contrary, joins are very computation-intense and will be executed as late as possible. The resulting **execution plan** consists in a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG) that contains the tree of all required actions for a specific computation, ordered in the most effective fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This has also drawbacks.** Since the computation is optimized for the end result, the intermediate stages are discarded by default. So if you need a DataFrame multiple times, you have to cache it in memory because if you don't Spark will recompute it every single time. \n",
